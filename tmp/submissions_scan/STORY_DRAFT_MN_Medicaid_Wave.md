# After $250M Food Fraud, Minnesota Faces New Medicaid Fraud Wave

**Analysis | January 2026**

---

Minnesota is experiencing a second wave of large-scale government program fraud, this time targeting Medicaid services for housing assistance and autism treatment. Federal prosecutors have charged at least 16 individuals and 8 companies since September 2025.

## The New Schemes

### Housing Stabilization Services (HSS) Fraud
*Indictments: September 2025*

Housing Stabilization Services is a Medicaid program that helps people with disabilities and mental health conditions find and maintain housing. Prosecutors allege providers billed for services never rendered.

**Charged Entities:**
| Company | Location | Alleged Role |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Brilliant Minds Services LLC | Griggs-Midway Building, St. Paul | Fraudulent billing |
| Foundation First Services LLC | Unknown | "Paperwork mill" - provided fake documentation |
| Faladcare Inc. | Unknown | Father-son operation |
| Leo Human Services LLC | Unknown | Brothers operation |
| Liberty Plus LLC | Unknown | Brothers operation (linked to Leo) |

The "paperwork mill" designation for Foundation First Services LLC is significant—it suggests this company provided fraudulent documentation to multiple providers, potentially enabling a wider network of fraud.

### Autism/EIDBI Services Fraud
*Indictments: December 2025*

The Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention (EIDBI) program provides Medicaid-funded autism treatment. Minnesota's program has disbursed approximately $700 million.

**Charged Entities:**
| Company | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Star Autism Center LLC | Active prosecution | Cross-scheme connection to FOF |
| Pristine Health LLC | Active prosecution | |
| SafeLodgings Inc. | Owner is **FUGITIVE** | Kaamil Omar Sallah, 4 counts wire fraud |

### The Fugitive

**Kaamil Omar Sallah**, owner of SafeLodgings Inc., is currently wanted by federal authorities on four counts of wire fraud. His flight suggests the evidence against him is substantial.

## Total Scope (Known)

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Companies charged | 8 |
| Individuals charged | 16+ |
| Fugitives | 1 (Kaamil Omar Sallah) |
| Cross-scheme participants | 1 (Asha Farhan Hassan) |
| Programs targeted | 2 (HSS, EIDBI) |

## Comparison to Feeding Our Future

| Factor | FOF (2020-2022) | New Wave (2025) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Program | USDA Child Nutrition | Medicaid (HSS, EIDBI) |
| Total charged | 47 defendants | 16+ defendants (ongoing) |
| Estimated fraud | $250 million | TBD |
| Paperwork mills | Empire Cuisine, others | Foundation First Services |
| Fugitives | Multiple | 1 known |
| Cross-scheme links | N/A | Asha Farhan Hassan |

## Red Flags for Ongoing Fraud

Based on patterns from both FOF and the new cases, here are indicators that may signal additional fraudulent providers:

1. **Rapid growth** - Billing that increases dramatically year-over-year
2. **Clustering** - Multiple providers at same address or with overlapping ownership
3. **Credential gaps** - Staff listed with credentials not verified by licensing boards
4. **Shell company markers** - Recent formation, registered agent services, no web presence
5. **Network connections** - Ownership/officer ties to already-charged entities

## What State Officials Should Do

### Immediate Actions
1. **Audit credential verification** - Cross-reference all EIDBI provider credentials against licensing board records
2. **Billing anomaly review** - Flag providers with billing patterns similar to charged entities
3. **Ownership mapping** - Identify any providers with ties to charged individuals/companies

### Systemic Reforms
1. **Real-time verification** - Require credential checks at billing time, not just enrollment
2. **Beneficial ownership disclosure** - Require disclosure of all owners, not just registered agents
3. **Cross-program monitoring** - Flag individuals who appear across multiple Medicaid programs

## The Common Thread

Minnesota's fraud schemes share a disturbing pattern: they target programs serving vulnerable populations—children (FOF), people with disabilities (HSS), and children with autism (EIDBI). These programs often have:

- Less rigorous verification (trust-based systems)
- High reimbursement rates
- Limited auditing capacity
- Political pressure to expand access (which can mean loosening controls)

Until Minnesota addresses these structural vulnerabilities, the fraud will continue—just in different programs.
