## ~~STORY #1: FRASER CREDENTIAL FRAUD~~ - **DEBUNKED**

**Status: KILLED - January 4, 2026**

Investigation found all 6 Fraser employees have VALID, ACTIVE Minnesota licenses:
- David Hoch: LP6259 (Licensed Psychologist)
- Tandra Okanu: LMFT 4248 (Marriage & Family Therapist)
- Valerie Lardinois: LP5737 (Licensed Psychologist)
- Jessica Hase: LMFT 2897 (Marriage & Family Therapist)
- Michelle Manger-Plant: LMFT 3904 (Marriage & Family Therapist)
- Elizabeth Mann: LICSW 27190 (Clinical Social Worker)

**Methodology Error**: Original search only checked Board of Behavioral Health & Therapy (BBHT), which only covers LADC/LPC/LPCC. Psychologists, social workers, and MFTs are licensed by different boards. All 6 qualify as "mental health professionals" under MN Statute 245I.04.

## STORY #1: CROSS-SCHEME FRAUDSTER (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Headline Potential
**"Feeding Our Future Defendant Also Charged in Autism Fraud - First Evidence of Cross-Scheme Participation"**

### The Facts
