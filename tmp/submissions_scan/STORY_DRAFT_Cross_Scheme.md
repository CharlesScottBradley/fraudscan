# First "Cross-Scheme" Fraudster: Feeding Our Future Defendant Also Charged in Autism Fraud

**Breaking | January 2026**

---

A defendant in Minnesota's $250 million Feeding Our Future fraud case has now been tied to a second major fraud scheme—marking the first documented instance of an individual participating in multiple large-scale government program frauds in the state.

## The Connection

**Asha Farhan Hassan** pled guilty on December 18, 2025, to charges stemming from her involvement in BOTH:

1. **Feeding Our Future** - The $250 million federal child nutrition fraud scheme that led to 47 indictments in September 2022. Hassan received $465,000 from this scheme.

2. **Smart Therapy LLC** - Hassan's autism services company, which she enrolled in the Federal Child Nutrition Program under Feeding Our Future's sponsorship, creating a direct operational link between the two frauds.

Hassan pled guilty to wire fraud connected to the autism scheme, in which she submitted millions in fraudulent Medicaid claims for services never provided and paid cash kickbacks ($300-$1,500/month) to parents who enrolled their children.

## Why This Matters

### Fraud Networks Share Resources

The Hassan case suggests that Minnesota's fraud schemes are not isolated incidents but part of interconnected networks that:

- **Share personnel** - The same individuals work across multiple schemes
- **Share methods** - Billing fraud techniques transfer between programs
- **Share proceeds** - Money may flow between related operations

### "Feeding Our Future 2.0"

The autism services fraud wave emerging in late 2025 bears striking similarities to the FOF playbook:

| Element | Feeding Our Future | Autism Fraud Wave |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Program | USDA Child Nutrition | Medicaid EIDBI |
| Method | Fake meal counts | Fake service hours |
| Scale | $250 million | TBD (ongoing) |
| Entities | 200+ sites | 8+ providers charged |
| Cross-Over | Asha Farhan Hassan | Asha Farhan Hassan |

### The December 2025 Indictments

Hassan was charged alongside five other defendants in the December 2025 wave targeting autism services fraud:

**Autism/EIDBI Fraud Defendants:**
- Smart Therapy LLC (Asha Farhan Hassan - pled guilty)
- Pristine Health LLC
- SafeLodgings Inc. (owner **Kaamil Omar Sallah** fled to Amsterdam, Nov 2025)

**Housing Stabilization Services (HSS) Fraud** (September 2025):
- Brilliant Minds Services LLC
- Foundation First Services LLC (alleged "paperwork mill")
- Faladcare Inc.
- Leo Human Services LLC
- Liberty Plus LLC

## The Bigger Picture

Minnesota has now seen **three major waves** of government program fraud in four years:

1. **2020-2022**: Feeding Our Future ($250M, 47+ defendants)
2. **2025 Q3**: Housing Stabilization Services (HSS) fraud
3. **2025 Q4**: Autism/EIDBI Medicaid fraud

The Hassan case proves these aren't separate phenomena—they're connected.

## Outstanding Questions

1. **How many other FOF defendants are involved in the new schemes?** The DOJ has not disclosed whether other cross-scheme participants have been identified.

2. **Did FOF proceeds fund the new operations?** Some FOF defendants received millions before being caught. Where did that money go?

3. **Is there a central coordinator?** The sophistication of running parallel frauds suggests organization beyond individual opportunism.

4. **What other programs are vulnerable?** If fraud networks pivot between nutrition, housing, and autism services, what's next?
