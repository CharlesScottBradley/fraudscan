Hi,

Your latest submissions to SomaliScan have been reviewed. This email covers the **new work** since your previous approvals.

### Previously Approved & Paid

You've already received bounties for:
- **Impossible Billing V1** ($778K analysis) - This got Center Square coverage!
- **WA State Medicaid Provider Exclusions** (Dental/Medical networks)

### New Submissions Approved (3)

1. **Impossible Billing V2** - Updated analysis with $1.1M total (5 providers)
   - Expanded from V1 with additional providers and months
   - New providers: SUBAN, YASIR added to ELISE, JENAH, DAISY
   - Credit: Update/expansion bonus (not full bounty since V1 was paid)

2. **WA Corporate Relationships CSV**
   - Supplemental structured data for the LEIE exclusion networks
   - Machine-readable format for the entity relationships

3. **LEIE Corporate Relationships Documentation**
   - Additional methodology and documentation
   - Note: Some overlap with your prior Medicaid Exclusions submission

### Bounty Breakdown

| Impossible Billing V2 (expansion bonus) | $300 |
| Corporate Relationships CSV (new data format) | $150 |
| Documentation supplement | $50 |

Your bounty will be sent to the ETH wallet you provided:

0x7eA22f1f2D2FE51a022F003Fb3F41D53e319d40D
```

Payment will be processed within 7 business days.

### Impact Update

Your Impossible Billing analysis is now driving real coverage - The Center Square published their investigation citing the same providers and payment amounts you documented. This is exactly the kind of data journalism we want to enable.

Keep up the excellent work.

Best,
SomaliScan Team

## EMAIL 2: leskobrandonftw@gmail.com - $500

**Subject:** Your SomaliScan Submission Approved - $500 Bounty

---

Hi,

Your submission to SomaliScan has been reviewed and **approved**. This email confirms your bounty payment.

### Approved Submission

**WA-MN Trans-State Fraud Network**

We've independently verified several claims in your submission:

**Verified:**
- Jamila Abdi was charged with 1st Degree Murder in King County (March 2023, $2M bail)
- Hubaal Home Care exists at the address you cited (7126 MLK Jr Way S)
- "Abdi Jamila" is linked to "Hubaal Family Home Childcare" in state records
- Mohamed Abdi's 2021 Tukwila City Council campaign exists in WA PDC records
- Shamso Issak is Executive Director of Living Well Kent
- Living Well Kent received Best Starts for Kids grants from King County
- Awale Farah (Kent School Board) is married to Shamso Issak - there was a conflict of interest revote in 2022

**Already Public (Reduced Credit):**
- Shukri Olow receiving donations from FOF defendants - this was reported by KARE11 and American Experiment in 2022

**Unverified (Needs Further Investigation):**
- Whether Hubaal Home Care is actively billing Medicaid while owner is incarcerated/awaiting trial
- Abdi Osman Abdi / Zip Global LLC connection
- Green Valley AFH / Royal Oaks / Nalka shell network details

### Bounty Breakdown

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Novel verified connections (Hubaal ↔ Jamila Abdi, Living Well Kent network) | $350 |
| Investigation leads requiring follow-up (AFH shell network, Medicaid billing) | $150 |
| Shukri Olow / FOF donations | $0 (already public) |
| **TOTAL** | **$500** |

### Payment

Your bounty will be sent to the ETH wallet you provided:
```
0x5EDE0060B27D3b2Fd1b74D79DAef9C5380e1a4Cd
```

Payment will be processed within 7 business days.

### Follow-Up Opportunity

The key unverified claim - that Hubaal Home Care is still billing Medicaid while its owner awaits trial for murder - would be significant if documented. If you can obtain:

1. DSHS ProviderOne billing records showing payments after March 2023
2. Evidence of Jamila Abdi's current custody status (incarcerated vs. out on bail)
3. Documentation on the Green Valley AFH / Royal Oaks / Nalka network

...we'd consider an additional bounty for that evidence.

Thanks for the leads.

Best,
SomaliScan Team
