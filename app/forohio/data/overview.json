  "thesis": "Ohio's government spending system is designed to transfer public money to private interests through a series of mechanisms that make the transfers appear legitimate while removing any accountability.",
  "subtitle": "This is not incompetence. This is not inefficiency. This is design.",
  "conclusion": "The spending is not designed to serve the public. It's designed to serve the people who control it.",
  "elevatorPitch": "Ohio's government spending system is designed to transfer public money to private interests. The proof: spending grows 40x faster than population, contractors who fail get more money, and oversight committees are dissolved at 2 AM when they start investigating. This isn't incompetence - Medicaid directors own stock in the companies they give contracts to, prison directors come from the companies they sell prisons to, and the one politician who got caught took $60 million in bribes. The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed - just not for taxpayers.",
