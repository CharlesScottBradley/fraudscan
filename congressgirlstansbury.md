## RED FLAG #11: $2.75 BILLION HEALTHCARE FRAUD - STANSBURY'S CONSTITUENTS WERE THE VICTIMS

### The Largest Healthcare Fraud Targeting Native Americans in History

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Fraud** | $2.75 BILLION |
| **People Charged** | 193 nationwide |
| **Arizona Indictments** | 120+ |
| **Native Americans Killed** | 40+ died in sober living homes |
| **Missing Persons (NM)** | 30+ from Gallup area alone |
| **Primary Victims** | Navajo, Zuni - Stansbury's constituents |

### The Scheme

Fraudsters established fake "sober living homes" and behavioral health clinics that:
- Recruited vulnerable Native Americans with cash, drugs, alcohol
- Transported them in unmarked vans from NM reservations to Arizona
- Billed Arizona Medicaid (AHCCCS) American Indian Health Program for services never provided
- Victims were beaten, sex trafficked, locked in homes with minimal food
- **At least 40 died** from drug/alcohol use in these facilities

### Key Defendants

| Defendant | Organization | Fraud Amount | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Rita Anagho** | Tusa Integrated Clinic | $69M | **GUILTY** May 2025 |
| **Adam Mutwol** | Community Hope Wellness | $57M | **INDICTED** |
| **Daud Koleosho** | Community Hope Wellness | $57M | **INDICTED** |
| **Theodore Mucuranyana** | Hope of Life Church | $60M laundering | **INDICTED** |
| **Morgan Ortiz** | NM substance abuse program | $800K+ | **INDICTED** (NM) |

### New Mexico Victims

**Zuni Pueblo** (Stansbury earmarked $5.08M):
- Anders Hustito's son **Jeffrey Hustito, 43, DIED** at a sober living home in Glendale, AZ (2022)
- Zuni Pueblo police cooperated with fraud investigation

**Navajo Nation** (spans into NM-01):
- Declared **public health state of emergency**
- Launched "Operation Rainbow Bridge" to find missing members
- Victims picked up in unmarked vans from NM portions of reservation

**Gallup, NM**:
- **35 missing person reports** filed connected to AZ sober homes
- 14 people STILL MISSING
- Gallup Police cooperated with FBI investigation

### Stansbury's Position & Earmarks

**Committee Oversight:**
- Sits on **House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs**
- This committee has direct oversight of tribal healthcare programs
- Advocated for INCREASED funding to the exact programs being exploited

**Behavioral Health Earmarks:**

| Organization | Amount | Issue |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **First Nations Community HealthSource** | $1,000,000 | DOJ OIG audit: **$174,300 "questioned costs"** |
| **Town of Bernalillo Behavioral Health Center** | $8,000,000 | Operator UNKNOWN |
| **Sandoval County Behavioral Health Clinic** | $8,000,000 | "Tribal stakeholders" - unspecified |

**The Pattern:**
```
STANSBURY ADVOCATES FOR:
├─ Increased tribal healthcare funding
├─ Expanded behavioral health services
├─ Opioid treatment for Native Americans
│
WHILE:
├─ $2.75B fraud exploits these exact programs (2019-2024)
├─ Her constituents are PRIMARY VICTIMS
├─ 40+ die, 30+ go missing from her state
├─ First Nations (she earmarked $1M) has DOJ audit problems
├─ Her committee provides NO meaningful oversight
```

### Questions Requiring Investigation

1. **Who operates** the $8M Bernalillo Behavioral Health Center?
2. **What were the findings** in the DOJ OIG audit of First Nations Community HealthSource?
3. **Did Stansbury meet with** any indicted behavioral health providers?
4. **What oversight did her committee conduct** during the 5-year fraud (2019-2024)?
5. **Are any fraud defendants connected** to her tribal donor network?

## RED FLAG #12: CARTEL ↔ HEALTHCARE FRAUD CROSSOVER

### The Fentanyl Connection

**Staff at fake sober living homes gave fentanyl directly to victims:**

| Victim | What Happened | Outcome |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Honyumptewa** | House manager said "I have a pill for you" - it was fentanyl | **Cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, feeding tube** |
| **Jeffrey Hustito** (Zuni) | Smoked fentanyl with another resident at sober home | **DIED** (Glendale, AZ, 2022) |
| **40+ others** | Drug/alcohol deaths at sober homes (2022-2024) | **DEAD** |

**The same drug (fentanyl) appears in BOTH criminal networks connected to Stansbury:**

```
CARTEL FENTANYL NETWORK (Stansbury's Donors)
├─ Isleta Casino: 37,000 fentanyl pills seized (Nov 2025)
├─ Sandia Resort: Fentanyl-for-sex operation (Sept 2024)
├─ Mescalero Apache: 34 charged in meth ring (2015-2016)
├─ SOURCE: Sinaloa Cartel controls NM drug corridor
│
↓ SAME DRUG SUPPLY ↓
│
HEALTHCARE FRAUD NETWORK (Stansbury's Constituents = Victims)
├─ Staff gave fentanyl to patients at fake sober homes
├─ Victims "kept dependent" on drugs to stay in programs longer
├─ 40+ died from fentanyl/drug overdoses at facilities
├─ Victims recruited from Navajo, Zuni - Stansbury's district
```

### The Money Laundering Pattern

**Both networks move money internationally:**

| Network | Method | Destination |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Healthcare Fraud** | Happy House → Hope of Life Church | **$2M wired to Rwanda** |
| **Casino Money** | FinCEN documented tribal casino laundering | Mexico, offshore |
| **Drug Money** | Sinaloa Cartel operations | Mexico |

### Stansbury's Dual Position

**She sits on committees overseeing BOTH:**

1. **House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs**
   - Oversees Indian Health Service
   - Oversees tribal healthcare programs
   - The EXACT programs exploited by $2.75B fraud

2. **Hearing on "Biden's Border Crisis: Examining Efforts to Combat International Criminal Cartels"**
   - Heard testimony on cartel activity in Indian Country
   - Her donor tribes have active fentanyl trafficking
   - She advocates for MORE funding with LESS oversight

### The Trafficking Pattern

**"White Van Syndrome" - How victims were recruited:**

| Location | Method | Who Did It |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Phoenix Indian Medical Center** | Vans staked out facility | Paid recruiters ($40K/month) |
| **NM Reservations** | Approached at gas stations, flea markets | Promised food, shelter |
| **Navajo Nation (NM)** | Woman offered alcohol, woke up in Phoenix | Unmarked vans |

**This is functionally human trafficking** - Navajo AG Ethel Branch called it "a humanitarian and human rights crisis."

### Why This Matters for Stansbury

1. **Her constituents were the PRIMARY VICTIMS** of both drug trafficking and healthcare fraud
2. **She receives donations from tribes** with active drug trafficking at their casinos
3. **She earmarks millions to tribal entities** with no apparent oversight
4. **She sits on oversight committees** that failed to detect either scheme
5. **She advocates for MORE funding** to programs being exploited

### Questions

1. **Did any of the $2.75B fraud money flow through NM tribal entities?**
2. **Are the recruiters who targeted Navajo/Zuni connected to tribal leadership?**
3. **Is there any connection between casino drug operations and healthcare fraud recruiters?**
4. **What oversight did Stansbury's committee conduct during the fraud (2019-2024)?**
5. **Did First Nations Community HealthSource ($1M Stansbury earmark) have any connection to Arizona fraud operators?**

## DEEP DIVE: $16.69M Child Development Center

### The Request vs. Reality

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Amount Requested** | $16,693,678 |
| **Amount Approved** | ~$850,000 (per news reports) |
| **Pueblo Population** | ~500 people |
| **Median Age** | 52 years old |
| **Population Trend** | Declining (515 → 494 from 2022-2023) |
| **Estimated Children** | ~50 max |

### Cost Comparison

| Facility | Total Cost | Capacity | Per Child |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Sandia CDC (requested)** | $16.69M | ~50 children | **$333,937** |
| Santo Domingo Pueblo CDC | $13.4M | 100+ children | ~$134,000 |
| Typical Military CDC | $30-45M | 200-500 children | ~$90-150K |

### Analysis

The $16.69M request is **massively inflated** for a pueblo with:
- Only ~500 total members
- Median age of 52 (aging population)
- Declining population
- Probably only 30-50 children

Even the comparable **Santo Domingo Pueblo** facility (800+ youth, 100+ capacity) cost only $13.4M.

**Conclusion:** The earmark request appears designed to maximize federal funding to a tribe that donated $6,600 to Stansbury, rather than reflecting actual community need.

## CORRECTION: Individual-Named Earmarks (Data Entry Issue)

**UPDATE:** The "recipient" field in the official House data contains **contact person names** in some cases, not actual recipients. This is a data entry pattern seen across 236 earmarks from many members of Congress, not unique to Stansbury.

| Listed "Recipient" | Actual Recipient | Amount | Contact Person's Role |
|-------------------|------------------|--------|----------------------|
| Chris Gillespie | **Village of Bosque Farms** | $10,000,000 | Mayor |
| Jeremias Silva | **Valencia County** | $8,000,000 | Grants Director |
| Matthew Geisel | **City of Rio Rancho** | $3,536,000 | City Manager |
| Marianne Billy | **Corn Maiden Early Learning** | $2,000,000 | Project contact |

**Verified:** News reports confirm "The village of Bosque Farms recently announced it has been awarded $10 million" - not Chris Gillespie personally.

## RED FLAG #2: Massively Inflated Per Capita Costs

| Project | Amount Requested | Population | Per Capita Cost |
|---------|------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Sandia CDC** | $16,693,678 | ~500 | **$33,387** |
| **Estancia Town Hall** | $5,560,000 | 1,328 | **$4,188** |
| **Fort Sumner Fire** | $2,250,000 | 852 | **$2,641** |
| **Bosque Farms Wastewater** | $10,000,000 | 4,111 | **$2,433** |
| **Peralta Fire Station** | $7,678,352 | 3,470 | **$2,213** |

### Comparison
- Peralta Fire Station: Requested $7.68M, **only approved $1M** (news reports)
- Sandia CDC: Requested $16.69M, **only approved $850K** (news reports)

The pattern: Request wildly inflated amounts, get much smaller amounts approved.

## RED FLAG #3: Duplicate Earmark Requests

**Same projects requested multiple years = double/triple dipping**

| Project | FY2024 | FY2025 | FY2026 | Total |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Rio Grande Pueblos Irrigation | - | $72.26M | $82.7M | **$154.96M** |
| Lincoln County EOC | - | $3M | $3M | **$6M** |
| Estancia Town Hall | - | $2.26M | $3.3M | **$5.56M** |
| Fort Sumner Fire | - | $950K | $1.3M | **$2.25M** |
| ABQ Temporary Shelter | - | $1.7M | $2M | **$3.7M** |
| APD Crime Lab | - | $800K | $800K | **$1.6M** |
| Bernalillo County Sheriff Vehicles | $1M | $500K | $1M | **$2.5M** |
| NM State Police Tech | $500K | $2.5M | $1.65M | **$4.65M** |

## RED FLAG #4: Request vs. Approved Amounts

Evidence suggests Stansbury requests vastly inflated amounts:

| Project | Requested | Approved | Difference |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Peralta Fire Station | $7,678,352 | ~$1,000,000 | **-87%** |
| Sandia CDC | $16,693,678 | ~$850,000 | **-95%** |

News quote: "[The $1 million approved is] far less than the nearly $8 million the congresswoman requested"

> **"Biden's Border Crisis: Examining Efforts to Combat International Criminal Cartels and Stop Illegal Drug Trafficking Targeting Indian Country"**

| **Cartel control** | Sinaloa and Juárez cartels have "nearly total control" over NM drug trafficking |

## RED FLAG #8: CASINO MONEY LAUNDERING PATTERN

**FinCEN has documented tribal casino money laundering:**

| Case | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Minnesota tribal casino** | Fined $250K for AML violations |
| **Escort service case** | $3M laundered through slot machines at tribal casino |

**FinCEN Requirements for Tribal Casinos:**

- Currency Transaction Reports for $10K+ transactions
- Subject to Bank Secrecy Act

**Question:** Are Sandia/Isleta casinos filing proper SARs? What do their SAR filings show?

**Sources:**
- [FinCEN: Anti-Money Laundering Controls for Indian Tribal Casinos](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/anti-money-laundering-controls-indian-tribal-casinos)
- [FinCEN: Minnesota Tribal Casino Penalty](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-assesses-civil-money-penalty-against-minnesota-based-tribal-casino)

## CIRCUMSTANTIAL THEORY: CARTEL MONEY FLOW

```
DONATIONS FROM TRIBES WITH:
├─ Active drug trafficking at casinos (Isleta, Sandia)
├─ Historical meth hub (Mescalero)
├─ Convicted embezzler governor (Santa Ana)
│
FLOW TO STANSBURY WHO:
├─ Sits on committee overseeing cartel activity in Indian Country
├─ Secures $298M in earmarks (minimal oversight)
├─ 95% of earmark requests get rejected (inflated asks = testing limits?)
│
EARMARKS GO TO:
├─ "Child Development Centers" (hard to audit, no visible progress)
├─ "Infrastructure" projects (construction = easy to inflate costs)
├─ Tribal entities with casino cash flows (mixing legitimate/illegitimate funds)
```

**If this theory is correct:**
1. Casino revenues (potentially including drug money) fund tribal PACs
2. Tribal PACs donate to Stansbury
3. Stansbury secures earmarks for tribal "projects"
4. Projects are inflated or never completed
5. Funds flow back through tribal accounts
6. Cycle repeats

---

## QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION

### Earmark Verification
1. **Has any of Stansbury's earmark money actually been spent?**
   - Can we find construction permits, contracts, photos?
2. **Sandia CDC**: $16.69M requested → $850K approved. Where did the $850K go?
   - Any building permits filed?
   - Is there actually a new building?

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (January 2026)

### The Basics
- **Position:** U.S. Representative (D-NM-01), Albuquerque area
- **Key Roles:** Democrat Vice Chair of Congressional Native American Caucus; House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs
- **Earmarks:** $298.4M total (#2 in Congress by volume, #36 by amount)
- **Tribal Donations:** $97K from 31 tribes (68% from outside New Mexico)

### Criminal Network by the Numbers

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Convicted felons in donor network | 8+ |
| Tribes under federal investigation | 2+ |
| Indicted individuals connected to donors | 5+ |
| Endorsers with criminal history | 1 (rape indictment) |
| Earmark recipients with audit problems | 3 |
| Drug trafficking cases at donor casinos | 5+ |
| Healthcare fraud victims (her constituents) | 40+ dead, 30+ missing |

### Key Findings

1. **8+ convicted felons** donated to Stansbury through tribal PACs
2. **$2.75B healthcare fraud** killed 40+ of her constituents (Navajo, Zuni)
3. **Fentanyl trafficking** documented at 3+ donor tribal casinos
4. **James Mountain** (APCG Chairman who endorsed her) was indicted for rape in 2008, arrested for DWI in 2025
5. **$3,300 → $3,575,000 connection**: Santa Ana Pueblo donated $3,300; their former governor embezzled $3.575M
6. **Earmark recipients** include organizations with DOJ audit problems and no-bid contract violations

### How It Connects

```
STANSBURY'S POSITION
├─ Vice Chair, Congressional Native American Caucus
├─ House Natural Resources Subcommittee (Indian Affairs)
├─ Oversight of tribal healthcare programs
├─ Oversight of cartel activity in Indian Country
│
RECEIVES DONATIONS FROM:
├─ 8+ tribes with convicted felons/criminal activity
├─ Casinos with active fentanyl trafficking
├─ Tribes under federal investigation
│
GIVES EARMARKS TO:
├─ Organizations with DOJ audit problems
├─ Tribes where serial murderers operate
├─ Recipients with no-bid contract violations
│
HER CONSTITUENTS:
├─ Victims of $2.75B healthcare fraud
├─ 40+ dead from fentanyl at fake sober homes
├─ 30+ still missing from Gallup, NM
│
ENDORSERS:
└─ James Mountain - indicted for rape, arrested for DWI
```

### Bottom Line

Rep. Melanie Stansbury receives money from tribes with convicted embezzlers and drug trafficking, gives earmarks to organizations with audit failures, sits on oversight committees that failed to detect $2.75B fraud targeting her own constituents, and accepted an endorsement from a man indicted for rape.

**She has not been charged with any wrongdoing**, but the pattern of connections warrants further investigation.
